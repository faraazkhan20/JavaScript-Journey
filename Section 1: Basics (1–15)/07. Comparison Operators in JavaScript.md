### Topic 7: Comparison Operators in JavaScript

**Comparison operators** in JavaScript are used to compare two values and return a boolean result: either `true` or `false`. These operators are critical in building logic for conditions, loops, and validations. They allow you to compare numbers, strings, variables, and expressions.

The most basic comparison operator is the **equality operator (`==`)**. It checks if two values are equal but performs **type coercion**, meaning it tries to convert both values to the same type before comparing.

```javascript
console.log(5 == '5'); // true (because '5' is converted to number)
```

This can lead to unexpected results, so JavaScript provides the **strict equality operator (`===`)**, which checks both **value and type** without type conversion.

```javascript
console.log(5 === '5'); // false (number vs string)
console.log(5 === 5);   // true
```

Similarly, the **inequality operator (`!=`)** checks if two values are not equal, and it allows type coercion:

```javascript
console.log(10 != '10'); // false
```

For more accurate checks, use the **strict inequality operator (`!==`)**, which ensures both value and type are different:

```javascript
console.log(10 !== '10'); // true
```

Then we have **greater than (`>`)**, **less than (`<`)**, **greater than or equal to (`>=`)**, and **less than or equal to (`<=`)**. These are used for numerical and alphabetical comparisons:

```javascript
console.log(10 > 5);   // true
console.log(10 < 5);   // false
console.log(10 >= 10); // true
console.log(7 <= 8);   // true
```

These also work with strings based on **lexicographic (dictionary) order**:

```javascript
console.log("apple" < "banana"); // true
console.log("a" > "A");          // true (lowercase is greater in ASCII)
```

In real-world scenarios, comparison operators are most useful inside `if` statements or loops. For example:

```javascript
let score = 85;
if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 75) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: C or lower");
}
```

Here, comparison operators are used to decide which grade to assign based on the score.

You can also combine comparisons with logical operators like `&&` (and), `||` (or) to form more complex conditions:

```javascript
let age = 20;
let hasLicense = true;

if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
  console.log("Eligible to drive");
} else {
  console.log("Not eligible");
}
```

To wrap up, comparison operators let you **evaluate relationships** between values. Using them correctly is key to writing conditional logic, from validating user input to controlling program flow. Practice by writing small condition checks, comparing values of different types, and combining comparisons to get comfortable with these powerful operators.
