### Topic 4: Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`)

In JavaScript, **variables** are containers used to store data like numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and more. Before you can use a variable, you need to declare it. JavaScript provides three main ways to declare variables: using `var`, `let`, and `const`. Though they all create variables, they differ in terms of **scope**, **reassignment**, and **hoisting**.

Let’s start with `var`. This was the original keyword used to declare variables in older versions of JavaScript. Variables declared with `var` are **function-scoped**, which means they’re accessible anywhere within the function they were declared in, even before their declaration due to **hoisting**. However, `var` has several quirks that can lead to bugs, so it’s generally not recommended in modern JavaScript.

Example:

```javascript
function exampleVar() {
  console.log(x); // undefined (due to hoisting)
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
}
exampleVar();
```

In this example, `x` is hoisted to the top of the function scope but without its value. So the first log gives `undefined`.

Next is `let`, introduced in ES6. It is **block-scoped**, meaning it's only accessible within the block (like `{}`) where it is declared. `let` also does **not** allow re-declaring the same variable in the same scope, and it respects **temporal dead zone** — meaning you cannot access it before the line where it’s declared.

Example:

```javascript
function exampleLet() {
  // console.log(y); // ReferenceError
  let y = 20;
  console.log(y); // 20
}
exampleLet();
```

Here, trying to access `y` before declaration throws an error. This makes `let` more predictable and safer than `var`.

Finally, `const` is also **block-scoped** like `let`, but with one key difference: you **cannot reassign** a variable declared with `const`. It must be initialized at the time of declaration, and its value cannot change later. However, if the value is an **object or array**, its properties or items can still be modified.

Example:

```javascript
const name = "Faraaz";
// name = "Ayaan"; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

const user = { age: 25 };
user.age = 30; // This is allowed
console.log(user.age); // 30
```

So `const` ensures the **binding** (the variable reference) remains constant, not necessarily the data itself.

When should you use which?

* Use `const` by default for values that don’t change.
* Use `let` for values that will change (like loop counters, form inputs, etc.).
* Avoid `var` unless working in old JS environments.

In summary, `var`, `let`, and `const` are all used to declare variables, but `let` and `const` are preferred in modern JavaScript for their predictable behavior and scope safety. Mastering these will make your code cleaner, more secure, and easier to debug.
