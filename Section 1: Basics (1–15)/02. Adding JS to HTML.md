### Topic 2: Adding JS to HTML

Adding JavaScript to HTML is how you make your web pages interactive and dynamic. There are three main ways to include JavaScript code in an HTML document: **inline**, **internal**, and **external**. Each method serves different purposes and is useful depending on your project’s complexity.

The simplest way is **inline JavaScript**, where you write code directly inside an HTML element’s event attribute. For example, if you want a button to show an alert message when clicked, you can add JavaScript inside the button tag using the `onclick` attribute:

```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello! You clicked the button.')">Click Me</button>
```

This is easy for small tasks but can get messy if your JavaScript logic grows complex because it mixes HTML structure and behavior.

A better way for more code is **internal JavaScript**, where you place your script inside a `<script>` tag in the HTML file. Usually, this is done inside the `<head>` or at the end of the `<body>` section. Placing it at the end of `<body>` is recommended to ensure that the page content loads before the script runs, improving performance and preventing errors accessing HTML elements that might not be loaded yet.

Here’s an example of internal JavaScript that changes the content of a paragraph when a button is clicked:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Internal JS Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="message">This is the original message.</p>
  <button onclick="changeMessage()">Change Message</button>

  <script>
    function changeMessage() {
      document.getElementById('message').innerText = "The message has been changed!";
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the JavaScript function `changeMessage()` is defined inside the `<script>` tag. When you click the button, it changes the paragraph text by accessing the element through its ID.

For larger projects, or when you want to keep your JavaScript code organized and reusable, **external JavaScript** is preferred. You write your JavaScript in a separate `.js` file and then link it inside the HTML with a `<script>` tag using the `src` attribute.

For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>External JS Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="demo">Click the button to change this text.</p>
  <button onclick="changeText()">Change Text</button>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

And in the external file named `script.js`:

```javascript
function changeText() {
  document.getElementById('demo').innerText = "Text changed by external JS!";
}
```

This keeps your HTML clean and separates structure from behavior, which is a good practice for maintainability.

To summarize, JavaScript can be added to HTML inline for quick and simple tasks, internally inside `<script>` tags for moderate complexity, and externally by linking `.js` files for larger applications. Using these methods properly helps keep your code clean, organized, and easier to maintain.
