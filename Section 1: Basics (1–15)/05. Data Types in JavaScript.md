### Topic 5: Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript is a **dynamically typed** language, meaning variables do not have fixed types. A variable can hold any type of data, and its type can change at runtime. Understanding JavaScript’s **data types** is essential for writing reliable, bug-free code. These types fall into two categories: **primitive types** and **reference types** (also called non-primitive types).

Let's begin with **primitive data types**. These are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They include:

1. **String** — represents textual data.

   ```javascript
   let name = "Faraaz";
   console.log(typeof name); // "string"
   ```

2. **Number** — represents both integers and floating-point numbers.

   ```javascript
   let age = 25;
   let height = 5.9;
   console.log(typeof age);   // "number"
   console.log(typeof height); // "number"
   ```

3. **Boolean** — true or false values, often used in condition checks.

   ```javascript
   let isLoggedIn = true;
   console.log(typeof isLoggedIn); // "boolean"
   ```

4. **Undefined** — a variable declared but not assigned a value.

   ```javascript
   let score;
   console.log(score);        // undefined
   console.log(typeof score); // "undefined"
   ```

5. **Null** — represents an intentional absence of value.

   ```javascript
   let data = null;
   console.log(data);        // null
   console.log(typeof data); // "object" (this is a known JS bug)
   ```

6. **Symbol** — a unique and immutable value, often used as object keys (advanced use).

   ```javascript
   let id = Symbol("id");
   console.log(typeof id); // "symbol"
   ```

7. **BigInt** — used to store integers larger than the `Number` limit.

   ```javascript
   let big = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
   console.log(typeof big); // "bigint"
   ```

Now, let’s explore **reference (non-primitive) types**. These include:

1. **Objects** — a collection of key-value pairs.

   ```javascript
   let person = {
     name: "Ayaan",
     age: 30
   };
   console.log(typeof person); // "object"
   ```

2. **Arrays** — ordered collections of values.

   ```javascript
   let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
   console.log(typeof colors); // "object"
   ```

3. **Functions** — a block of code that performs a task.

   ```javascript
   function greet() {
     console.log("Hello");
   }
   console.log(typeof greet); // "function"
   ```

Unlike primitive types, reference types are stored by **reference**. This means that if you assign one object to another variable, they both point to the same memory location:

```javascript
let obj1 = { val: 10 };
let obj2 = obj1;
obj2.val = 20;
console.log(obj1.val); // 20 (because both refer to the same object)
```

Understanding data types is key for writing correct logic, especially in condition checks, comparisons, and function handling. You can always use `typeof` to check a variable’s type during debugging. Knowing how data behaves in memory—by value (for primitives) or by reference (for objects)—will help you avoid many bugs as you write more advanced JavaScript code.
