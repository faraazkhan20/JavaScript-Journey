### Topic 1: What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a powerful, high-level **programming language** used to add **interactivity**, **dynamism**, and **logic** to web pages. While HTML provides the structure and CSS handles styling, JavaScript brings the webpage to life by responding to user actions, changing content dynamically, validating forms, displaying alerts, fetching data from servers, and much more. It's one of the core technologies of the **web development triad**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Initially developed by **Brendan Eich** in 1995, JavaScript was created in just 10 days. Despite its name, JavaScript has no relation to Java. It was named so mainly for marketing reasons. Over time, JavaScript has grown from a simple scripting tool for browsers into a powerful and versatile language used in both **frontend** (client-side) and **backend** (server-side using platforms like Node.js) development.

Let's start with a simple example of how JavaScript works with an HTML page. Here's a basic webpage using JavaScript to display a welcome message:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JavaScript Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <button onclick="showMessage()">Click Me</button>

  <script>
    function showMessage() {
      alert("Hello! You clicked the button.");
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, when the user clicks the button, JavaScript runs the `showMessage()` function, which pops up a message using the `alert()` function. This shows how JavaScript can respond to events and interact with the user.

JavaScript code can be placed in three ways:

1. **Inline** — directly inside HTML attributes (`onclick="..."`)
2. **Internal** — in a `<script>` tag inside an HTML file (as above)
3. **External** — stored in a separate `.js` file and linked using `<script src="script.js"></script>`

Here’s an example of an external JavaScript file:

**index.html:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>External JS</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="demo">Click the button to change this text.</p>
  <button onclick="changeText()">Change Text</button>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**script.js:**

```javascript
function changeText() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerText = "You clicked the button!";
}
```

JavaScript runs directly in the user's browser. You don’t need to install anything to run basic JS — just open your browser, open Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`), go to the **Console**, and type JavaScript code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello from the console!");
```

This prints the message in the browser console.

In summary, JavaScript is essential for building interactive web experiences. It’s beginner-friendly, runs in every modern browser, and is your gateway into the world of full-stack development.
