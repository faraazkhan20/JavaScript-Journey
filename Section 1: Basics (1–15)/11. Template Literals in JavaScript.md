### Topic 11: Template Literals in JavaScript

**Template literals** (also known as template strings) are a modern way to work with strings in JavaScript. Introduced in ES6, they allow for **easier string formatting**, **multi-line strings**, and **embedded expressions**, making your code cleaner and more readable.

#### Basic Syntax

Template literals are enclosed using **backticks** (\`\`\`\`), not single or double quotes. Here’s a simple example:

```javascript
let name = "Faraaz";
let message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(message); // "Hello, Faraaz!"
```

Inside the backticks, you can use the `${}` syntax to embed **any valid JavaScript expression**—not just variables.

#### Embedding Expressions

You’re not limited to just inserting variables. You can include full expressions inside `${}`:

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
console.log(`The sum is ${a + b}`); // "The sum is 15"
```

Even function calls can be used:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hi, ${name}`;
}
let username = "Ali";
console.log(`${greet(username)}!`); // "Hi, Ali!"
```

This makes template literals much more powerful than traditional string concatenation.

#### Multi-line Strings

Before template literals, creating multi-line strings was cumbersome, requiring `\n` and `+` signs:

```javascript
let oldWay = "Line 1\n" + "Line 2";
```

With template literals, just press enter:

```javascript
let message = `Line 1
Line 2`;
console.log(message);
```

This is especially useful when formatting HTML or long messages:

```javascript
let html = `
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, ${name}</h1>
    <p>Welcome to JavaScript</p>
  </div>
`;
```

#### Nesting Template Literals

You can even nest template literals by combining multiple expressions:

```javascript
let user = {
  firstName: "Zara",
  lastName: "Khan"
};

let fullName = `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`;
console.log(`Welcome, ${fullName}!`);
```

#### Tagged Template Literals (Advanced Use)

Tagged templates are an advanced feature that lets you **process** template literals with a custom function:

```javascript
function tag(strings, value) {
  return strings[0] + value.toUpperCase();
}

let name = "faraaz";
let result = tag`Hello, ${name}`;
console.log(result); // "Hello, FARAAZ"
```

In this case, the `tag` function gets called with the raw string and expression values.

#### Summary

Template literals improve how we work with strings in JavaScript. They eliminate messy concatenation, simplify multi-line strings, and let you embed expressions seamlessly. Use them wherever you need dynamic, readable string construction—especially when dealing with HTML generation, console outputs, or dynamic messages in your app.
