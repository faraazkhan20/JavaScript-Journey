### Topic 6: Arithmetic Operators in JavaScript

Arithmetic operators in JavaScript are symbols that let you perform **basic mathematical operations** on numbers. These include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. They work with both integer and floating-point numbers and are commonly used in tasks like calculations, counters, and logic building.

Let’s start with the **addition operator (`+`)**. This operator adds two numbers:

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
let result = a + b;
console.log(result); // 15
```

When used with strings, `+` performs **concatenation** instead of addition:

```javascript
let firstName = "Faraaz";
let lastName = " Khan";
console.log(firstName + lastName); // "Faraaz Khan"
```

The **subtraction operator (`-`)** subtracts the second value from the first:

```javascript
let x = 20;
let y = 8;
console.log(x - y); // 12
```

The **multiplication operator (`*`)** multiplies two values:

```javascript
let num1 = 4;
let num2 = 5;
console.log(num1 * num2); // 20
```

The **division operator (`/`)** divides the first number by the second:

```javascript
let total = 100;
let count = 4;
console.log(total / count); // 25
```

Be careful when dividing by zero. JavaScript returns `Infinity` or `-Infinity`:

```javascript
console.log(5 / 0);  // Infinity
console.log(-5 / 0); // -Infinity
```

The **modulus operator (`%`)** returns the **remainder** of a division:

```javascript
console.log(10 % 3); // 1
```

It’s often used in conditions like checking if a number is even:

```javascript
let number = 6;
if (number % 2 === 0) {
  console.log("Even");
} else {
  console.log("Odd");
}
```

The **exponentiation operator (`**`)** raises the first number to the power of the second:

```javascript
console.log(2 ** 3); // 8 (2 to the power of 3)
```

JavaScript also supports **increment (`++`)** and **decrement (`--`)** operators. These increase or decrease a value by one.

```javascript
let counter = 0;
counter++;
console.log(counter); // 1

counter--;
console.log(counter); // 0
```

You can use them as **prefix** or **postfix**, which affects when the increment happens:

```javascript
let a = 5;
console.log(++a); // 6 (increments, then returns)
console.log(a++); // 6 (returns, then increments)
console.log(a);   // 7
```

Arithmetic operators work with variables, literals, expressions, and even functions. They are essential in loops, conditional logic, form validations, calculations, and animations.

To summarize, JavaScript provides a rich set of arithmetic operators that help you perform all basic math operations. These operators are not just for calculations — they are the building blocks for decision-making and logic in your programs. Practicing with real examples and small exercises will help you understand their behavior deeply.
