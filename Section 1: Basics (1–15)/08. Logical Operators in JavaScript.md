### Topic 8: Logical Operators in JavaScript

**Logical operators** in JavaScript are used to combine or invert boolean values and expressions. These operators are essential in writing **conditional logic**, such as in `if` statements or loops, where multiple conditions must be evaluated together. The three primary logical operators in JavaScript are `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT).

Let's start with the **AND operator (`&&`)**. This operator returns `true` **only if both operands are true**. If either one is false, the result is false.

```javascript
let age = 22;
let hasLicense = true;

if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
  console.log("You can drive.");
} else {
  console.log("Driving not allowed.");
}
```

In this case, both conditions must be true: the person must be at least 18 years old **and** have a license.

If `age = 16` or `hasLicense = false`, the condition fails, and "Driving not allowed." is printed.

Now, the **OR operator (`||`)** returns `true` **if at least one operand is true**. It's useful when any one of multiple conditions can satisfy the requirement.

```javascript
let isWeekend = true;
let isHoliday = false;

if (isWeekend || isHoliday) {
  console.log("You can relax!");
} else {
  console.log("Time to work.");
}
```

Here, if it's either a weekend **or** a holiday, the condition will pass.

The third logical operator is the **NOT operator (`!`)**, which **inverts** a boolean value. If something is `true`, `!` turns it into `false`, and vice versa.

```javascript
let isOnline = false;

if (!isOnline) {
  console.log("User is offline.");
}
```

This condition checks if the user is **not** online.

Logical operators can also be chained and nested to handle more complex scenarios:

```javascript
let marks = 85;
let hasSubmitted = true;

if ((marks >= 80 && marks <= 100) && hasSubmitted) {
  console.log("Passed with distinction");
}
```

You can even use them in variable assignments:

```javascript
let loggedIn = true;
let username = loggedIn && "Faraaz"; 
console.log(username); // "Faraaz"
```

In this case, if `loggedIn` is true, `username` gets assigned `"Faraaz"`. Otherwise, it would be `false`. The `&&` operator returns the second value if the first is truthy. Since `loggedIn` is `true`, `username` becomes `"Faraaz"`.

One important concept to understand is **short-circuiting**:

* In `a && b`, if `a` is false, `b` is not evaluated.
* In `a || b`, if `a` is true, `b` is not evaluated.

Example:

```javascript
let a = false;
let b = true;

console.log(a && b); // false (b is not even checked)
console.log(a || b); // true (b is checked because a is false)
```

This can improve performance and avoid unnecessary computations or function calls.

To summarize, logical operators are fundamental for making decisions in JavaScript. They allow your code to respond to multiple conditions, determine complex truth values, and manage flow control effectively. Practicing combinations of conditions will help you write smarter and cleaner logic.
